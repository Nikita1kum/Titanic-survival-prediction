## Titanic Survival Prediction
    ## Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using various data science techniques in Python. The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, such as age, gender, class, and other relevant features. By applying machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic dataset. It includes the following files:

train.csv: Training data containing features and the target variable (Survived).
test.csv: Test data containing features without the target variable.
The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Passenger sex
Age: Passenger age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
